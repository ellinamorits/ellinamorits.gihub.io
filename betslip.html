                <h4 class="hero-heading">Context</h4>
                <p>
                    As I joined the company, I got assigned as the main UX-resource to the Bet Slip project. I learned
                    that it has been dragging on for two years with no visible outcomes. The project came from a need
                    for a tech rebuild. Thus, there came up an opportunity to streamline the user experience itself.
                </p>

                <h4 class="hero-heading">Challenges</h4>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was to define the new bet slip vision. Then set timelines and milestones for UX
                    and tech (the tech bit of it was very complex, hence the slow speed).
                </p>

                <p>
                    There were no defined KPIs at this stage, apart from ‘not breaking the most sensitive area of the
                    website’, so we had to make sure that we can prove that the new experience is an improvement.

                        <p>
                            I started with internal stakeholder interviews and workshops to get everyone on the same
                            page about what’s working, what’s not working and what they expect from the ‘new bet slip’.
                            We ended up with a massive list of pain points and requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time me and the project designer conducted competitor analysis which involved
                            extensive user testing.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            I also ran a pub session with users, just observing them watch football and place bets. This
                            was an amazing expreince which helped me learn lots about real behaviours. Moreover, it helped
                            validate the assumptions we already had and prioritise them. The ones that were quick wins
                            went straight into user testing and then live.

                            For the longer-term strategy we ran a few white-boarding sessions and defined a vision for
                            the first iteration - quick bet slip (QBS), which would not take you away from watching the
                            game or checking stats, but allow to place a bet seamlessly.

                        <p>
                            One of the engineers built a working dynamic prototype which allowed me to test a wide range
                            of scenarios with real data and real users, while the designer could consider all the visual
                            challenges. We also worked through all the error states, making them more actionable and
                            informative.

                            As the first version of QBS went live for the Beta group, me and the product manager made
                            sure to have all the analytics set up. Their verbal qualitative feedback helped us fix a few issues we
                            haven’t thought of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After that we went on to launch a multivariate test to see whether QBS should only pop up
                            for single bets, or accumulators and complex bets too.
                        </p>

                            We also made a list of further A/B tests, all aiming to make the experience even quicker
                            with ‘quick stakes’ or smart keyboard suggestions.

                            The results of even this first roll out were a real success, with a yearly projected uplift
                            worth of over £8mln.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reality check: the reality of it was, that in the midst of this project a crisis hit
                            another area, and v.2 of QBS got side-tracked. I documented all the UX decisions and
                            suggestions, as well as A/B test plans, so the next person can pick it up and make informed
                            decisions.
