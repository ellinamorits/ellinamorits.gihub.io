<p class="alttitle">2017 - Present</p>
<p>
Through a range of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies uncovering powerful insights and turning ideas into tangible outcomes whilst managing stakeholders' expectations.
Taking business problem statements through a lean discovery cycle of ideation, hypothesis creation, wireframe, rapid prototyping and usability testing to build confidence in features for a site that handles more weekly transactions than Amazon on Black Friday.
</p>

<p>
Implemented a bi-weekly usability testing programme that ensures the business can observe customers using the latest product iteration before development effort is wasted on unusable or undesirable focus areas. Constantly iterating on testing techniques, getting things done as lean as possible, while getting the right level of insights.  
</p>

<p>
Working closely with senior stakeholders on broader strategy as well as with development squads to ensure a smooth phased release to customers, re-prioritising as necessary.

	The teams are project-based and I am working with a few teams, I would like to go into more detail about two projects I  have been working on in the last few months. The following examples are just a small part of my daily work, which I will be happy to talk more about in person.
</p>

<h3>Promotions</h3>
<p>
I am working with the ‘Promotions’ squad on creating the best promotional experience in the industry as well as boosting customer loyalty. Working on promotions is tightly connected to working with marketing and hitting the financial KPIs, such as increasing share of wallet and bet days. From UX point of view it is an interesting challenge.
</p>

<p>
<img src="files/uploads/skybet/contextual research session.png" alt="contextual research session" />
</p>

<p>
With the business challenge of increasing loyalty we assessed all the opportunities and decided to take our loyalty scheme to the next level since the numbers suggested that engaged customers are 38% more valuable. We started the process with a strategy session. We looked at the existing journeys, did an analytics audit, talked to customers.   
Firstly, the contact centre complaints suggested that the main pain points are unclear Terms & Conditions as well as when free bets are credited. Then, brand tracker and marketing research showed that awareness of our promotions is relatively low. 

Working closely with a digital designer and product manager we made a list of pain points and opportunities based on all the data. Then asked ourselves what we already know, what we don’t know and how are we going to approach the challenge of redesigning the promotions experience and creating a community feeling for our users. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Afterwards, we had a few ideation sessions and creative workshops, which helped us consider different users and different use-cases.
</p>

<p>
<img src="files/uploads/skybet/story boards.jpg" alt="storyboards" />
</p>

<p>
Afterwards we developed the main concepts into prototypes, and had dedicated usability sessions externally and internally. Off the back of those sessions we proceeded with quant analysis to assess feature desirability. 
The findings allowed us together with the team including tech leads and BAs to go through what’s going to bring the highest value from UX and business points of view as well as be feasible tech-wise. 
</p>

<p>
In the meantime we addressed smaller issues of making T&Cs clearer and signposting the page better. We A/B tested placements across the user journey and got a big uplift in visits and engagement just from surfacing promotional journeys in more relevant instances and notifying people weekly about their progress with the loyalty scheme.
</p>

<p>
We have launched an MVP recently and are in the process of learning how well it's working. We are adjusting our roadmap accordingly and have a number of multivariate tests coming up.
Results to date are very positive - we exceeded the free bet budget and marketing expectations by engaging an unexpectedly high number of users.   
</p>


<h3>RequestABet</h3>

<p>
RequestABet is a feature that used to be industry leading but was abandoned for a while and  when I joined the team it was far behind all the competitors. Therefore, with RequestABet we had a different project approach.
</p>

<p>
We knew the biggest pain points in our product simply because the tech behind it could only allow for 40% of all interactions to be successful. The immediate next steps were clear - to bring the tech to the appropriate level and make sure the interactions are intuitive and enjoyable. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="files/uploads/skybet/competitor analysis.png" alt="competitor analysis" />
</p>


<p>
To get immersed into the project I did competitor analysis and remote usability testing for each of their products. The analysis gave food for thought and themes to research - since some features implemented by our competitors seems to be working better than others. 
<p>

<p>
<img src="files/uploads/skybet/remote testing findings.png" alt="remote testing" />
</p>

<p>
After that we had a session with the product manager and tech leads and discussed what the MVP is and what the big vision for the future is. Then we took a few designs to usability testing and worked out minor improvements on top of the MVP. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="files/uploads/skybet/usability testing findings.png" alt="usability testing findings" />
</p>

<p>
Then we sat down with the CRO and the analytics team to ensure that we definitely are tracking the roll-out of the new features and that we can get answers to the questions about behaviour changes if there are any. 
</p>

<p>
At this point of the project lifecycle we are waiting for a release to Beta customers, and in parallel looking at the grand vision. Mini design sprints dedicated to bet placement and bet tracking are planned.
