                <h4 class="hero-heading">Context</h4>
                <p>
                    Sberbank Technology is a Russian IT company providing services in software development and
                    implementation for Sberbank of Russia, Russia’s largest financial company. I joined when the
                    ambitious project of uniting all internal software into one system was already over a year old, but
                    barely anything has been launched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way the UX team was set up, each UX designer got a few dedicated projects, while establishing
                    best practices and processes for the wider business. I was leading UX across Corporate Investment
                    Banking, Corporate Account Management, Call Centers, Corporate Consulting, Financial Advising and
                    Personal Insurance.
                </p>

                <h4 class="hero-heading">Challenges</h4>
                <p>
                    There were specific challenges within every project, but I would like to focus on the overarching UX
                    work and challenges of dealing with a stream of various projects on different stages and different
                    agile maturity levels.

                            Our design team was continuously working on a design system; form UX point of view, I was
                            involved into usability testing of some components and making the case for new ones if they
                            were needed (as you had to prove that this was absolutely necessary, like a contact centre
                            component which has never been needed before that project, but ended up being reused for
                            other areas, that also wanted it)

                            address multiple locations of product teams & size of user base and their spread across the

                            When I joined, I helped unify how usability testing reports were presented and how we store
                            the learnings from discoveries and testing. Since there were multiple streams of work and it
                            was physically impossible to be in all meetings, we knew we needed more than a space for
                            sharing knowledge, we needed to make sure any product manager can access other teams’
                            documentation and quickly make sense of everything.

                                As for remote work, it was really difficult to get security sign off for most of the
                                tools, therefore I had to be creative and use Skype for Business, screen sharing, screen
                                recording, google docs and jira. There was a decent travel budget, which helped. Due to
                                some projects being tied to a specific region in Russia, I went on a few short trips,
                                which were used to learn as much as we can. I organised an ethnographic study for a
                                contact centre discovery phase; a two-day trip to observe and learn from a beta-launch
                                for corporate investment banking department, interviewed financial advisors at the place
                                of their work.

                            Design thinking and being resourceful were key to overcoming different maturity levels
                            across projects, dependencies between them & waterfall approach in some teams and
                            development going ahead before UX.

                        <p>
                            Within the projects that I personally oversaw, I had the freedom of choosing which
                            techniques to use, and when to use them; some teams were engaged in UX and made my work
                            easy. With some I had to prove the worth of UX - sometimes it was by taking the product
                            manager to a field trip (since we had to have them around for security reasons to get into
                            backoffice); sometimes it was taking them to see how the beta launch is performing (and
                            SURPRISE - every time we heard that the bank staff are not using the Beta, saying it made
                            their work more difficult, because it was done in ‘pre-UX time.’)

                        <h4>Key UX learnings</h4>
                        <p>
                            First a foremost - going into the field if you can - seeing the workstations, shadowing
                            employees throughout the day and even experiences the climate they are in made so much
                            difference. For example, we were working on an iPad version of the system which would
                            contain only the information managers need when they go to see a corporate client. We have
                            done a few rounds of usability testing in the Moscow head office and were excited to see the
                            beta launch in the regions. However, when we came in a couple of months, turned out that in
                            the cold of the north it is difficult to tap on small icons when you are wearing gloves, and
                            when you are on the go in extreme conditions you want to see even less information/purely
                            the key information and do all the actions in the minimum amount of time.

                            Secondly, making sure to look at the whole ecosystem. Even though the users of the system
                            were going to be bank employees, we had to do research around bank customers, as the system
                            needed to cater for any unexpected scenario and behaviour and without that no scenario we
                            took to usability would have been realistic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, finally, the lesson of never giving up and working as a team, so if your product manger
                            is resisting UX, other UX designers and UX managers could step in and push back. Having
                            senior management’s support was key, but we had to make sure there is consistent
                            communication and they are aware of where their help and influence are needed.
